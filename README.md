# General Use Chatbot

This project is a simple chatbot application that integrates a language model using Flask and OllamaLLM. The chatbot is designed to interact with users, respond to their queries, and provide context-aware conversational responses. The front-end interface is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Real-Time Interaction**: Chat messages are sent to the Flask backend, processed by a language model, and responses are returned to the user.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Maintains conversation history to generate relevant and coherent replies.
- **Dynamic Chat Interface**: Updates chat UI with new messages from both the user and the chatbot.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask, LangChain (`OllamaLLM`)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning**: LangChain's language model (`llama3`)

 
## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Flask application backend with endpoints for serving the chat interface and handling user queries.
- `templates/index.html`: HTML template for the chat interface.
